## Problem 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

there are variables: `r names(early_january_weather)` in the dataset, the size of dataset is `r nrow(early_january_weather) * ncol(early_january_weather)`, the mean temperature is `r mean(pull(early_january_weather,temp))`

```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

The scatterplot shows a clear diurnal pattern in temperature over time: temperatures tend to rise during daytime and drop overnight. Coloring by humid  shows that warmer periods generally coincide with lower humidity, while cooler periods tend to have higher humidity.
